# YOLOv8 Prediction using Python and OpenCV

This is a Python script for object detection predictions on an image using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model with OpenCV visualization.

**Prerequisites**

Before running the script, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

**Getting Started**

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the dependencies listed above.
- Open the yolo8\_object\_detection.ipynb file in a Python IDE or text editor.
- Set the image\_path variable to the image path you want to process.
- Run the script.

The script's output will be an OpenCV window displaying the input image with bounding boxes around detected objects.

**Note:** This script uses a pre-trained YOLOv8 model included in the yolov8n.pt file.
